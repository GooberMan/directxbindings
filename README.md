DirectX Bindings
Based on the DirectX headers published by Microsoft.

Requires the COM Bindings helper library.

This is a hand translation of the headers to D. Tested as far as my own code
allows. If they don't work for you, consider contributing updated definitions.

Released under a CC0 license since public domain is a mess internationally.
Do whatever you want with these. It's basically not my work, so I don't care.
